Python notebooks that illustrate some pattern formation models (mostly on triangular meshes and without periodic boundaries).

fem_brus_circle.ipynb : Brusselator reaction diffusion equation on a triangular mesh of a circle.  The boundary condition is Neumann with both fields having normal component of gradient equal to zero. The system is integrated with the scikit-fem finite element package. 

fem_complex_ginzburg_landau.ipynb:  Integrating the Complex Ginzburg Landau equation on a triangular mesh of a circle with the Neumann boundary condition.
